Allows WordPress to externalize user authentication and account creation to a Shibboleth Service Provider.

== Description ==

This plugin is designed to support integrating your WordPress site into your existing identity management infrastructure using a [Shibboleth] Service Provider.

WordPress can be configured so that all standard login requests will be sent to your configured Shibboleth Identity Provider or Discovery Service.  Upon successful authentication, a new WordPress account will be automatically provisioned for the user if one does not already exist. User attributes (username, first name, last name, display name, nickname, and email address) can be synchronized with your enterprise's system of record each time the user logs into WordPress.

Finally, the user's role within WordPress can be automatically set (and continually updated) based on any attribute Shibboleth provides.  For example, you may decide to give users with an eduPersonAffiliation value of *faculty* the WordPress role of *editor*, while the eduPersonAffiliation value of *student* maps to the WordPress role *contributor*.  Or you may choose to limit access to WordPress altogether using a special eduPersonEntitlement value.

= Contribute on GitHub =

This plugin is actively maintained by [michaelryanmcneill](https://profiles.wordpress.org/michaelryanmcneill) and the WordPress community, [using GitHub](https://github.com/michaelryanmcneill/shibboleth). Contributions are welcome, via pull request, [on GitHub](https://github.com/michaelryanmcneill/shibboleth). Issues can be submitted [on the issue tracker](https://github.com/michaelryanmcneill/shibboleth/issues).

== Installation ==

= Preface =

First and foremost, this plugin requires you to have a Shibboleth Service Provider installed and functional on your web server. This can be done many ways, but that is outside the scope of this plugin. Once you've configured the Shibboleth Service Provider, you can proceed with installing the plugin.

This plugin supports both "lazy sessions" (where requireSession is set to false) and "required sessions" (where requireSession is set to true).

Upon activation, the plugin will attempt to set the appropriate directives in WordPress's `.htaccess` file. You can prevent this from happening by defining the following `wp-config.php` constant:

    define('SHIBBOLETH_DISALLOW_FILE_MODS', true);

= Installation Process =

Visit "Plugins > Add New"
Search for "Shibboleth"
Activate the Shibboleth plugin from your Plugins page.
Configure the plugin from the Shibboleth settings page.

OR

Upload the "shibboleth" folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
Activate the Shibboleth plugin from your Plugins page.
Configure the plugin from the Shibboleth settings page.

= Troubleshooting =

If for some reason the plugin is unable to add the appropriate directives for Shibboleth, you can add the following to your `.htaccess` file.

    AuthType shibboleth
    Require shibboleth

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Shibboleth? =

From [the Shibboleth Consortium](https://www.shibboleth.net/index/):

> Shibboleth is a standards based, open source software package for web single sign-on across or within organizational boundaries. It allows sites to make informed authorization decisions for individual access of protected online resources in a privacy-preserving manner.

= How do I configure a Shibboleth Service Provider? =

For more information on how to install the Native Shibboleth Service Provider on Linux, see [this wiki article](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPLinuxInstall).

For more information on how to install the Native Shibboleth Service Provider on other operating systems, see [this wiki article](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPInstall).

For more information on how to install Shibboleth on Nginx, see [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/nginx-shib/nginx-http-shibboleth).

Note, we cannot provide support for installation, configuration, or troubleshooting of Shibboleth Service Provider issues.

= Can I extend the Shibboleth plugin to provide custom logic? =

Yes, the plugin provides a number of new [actions][] and [filters][] that can be used to extend the functionality of the plugin.  Search `shibboleth.php` for occurrences of the function calls `apply_filters` and `do_action` to find them all.  Then [write a new plugin][] that makes use of the hooks.  If your require additional hooks to allow for extending other parts of the plugin, please notify the plugin authors via the [support forum][].

Before extending the plugin in this manner, please ensure that it is not actually more appropriate to add this logic to Shibboleth.  It may make more sense to add a new attribute to your Shibboleth Identity Provider's attribute store (e.g. LDAP directory), or a new attribute definition to the  Identity Provider's internal attribute resolver or the Shibboleth Service Provider's internal attribute extractor.  In the end, the Shibboleth administrator will have to make that call as to what is most appropriate.

= version 2.0.1 (2018-01-17) =
 - Resolved a regression that prevented accounts from being created if they matched a group; [thanks to @Androclese for reporting](https://github.com/michaelryanmcneill/shibboleth/issues/22).
 - Resolved an issue where assets were not being properly included in the WordPress.org packaged plugin. 

= version 2.0 (2018-01-16) =
 - Changed the way we check for Shibboleth attributes. Now, by default, we only check standard environment variables for Shibboleth attributes. For most users, no additional configuration will be necessary. If you are using a specialized server configuration, such as a Shibboleth Service Provider on a reverse proxy or a server configuration that results in environment variables being sent with the prefix REDIRECT_, you should instead select the option specific to your server configuration. Selecting the "Redirected Environment Variables" option will look for attributes in environment variables prefixed with `REDIRECT_` while selecting the "HTTP Headers" option will look for attributes in environment variables (populated by HTTP Headers) prefixed with `HTTP_`. Most users should be fine leaving the default option selected; [thanks to @jrchamp for reporting](https://github.com/michaelryanmcneill/shibboleth/issues/8).
 - Changed the default behavior to not automatically update user roles.
 - Allow options to be defined via constants. Documentation has been added to the ["FAQ" section of the WordPress.org plugins page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shibboleth/#can-i-control-the-plugin-settings-with-constants-in-wpconfigphp).
 - Allow automatic and manual merging of local WordPress accounts with Shibboleth accounts. This prevents a collision from occurring if the Shibboleth email attribute matches an email that already exists in the `wp_users` table. This is configurable by an administrator.
 - Changed the options page to utilize a more modern design centered around tabs.
 - Added signifcant customizations to the login page to bring it more in-line with WordPress.com Single Sign On.
 - Disabled the sending of an email notifying user's that their email had changed when the Shibboleth plugin updates user attributes to prevent user confusion; props [@jrchamp](https://github.com/michaelryanmcneill/shibboleth/pull/19).
 - Removed the `shibboleth-mu.php` file as it is no longer relevant.

= version 1.8.1 (2017-09-08) =
 - Use sanitize_title rather than sanitize_user to sanitize user_nicename; props [@jrchamp](https://github.com/michaelryanmcneill/shibboleth/pull/4).
 - Changed activation and deactivation hooks to use `__FILE__`; props [@jrchamp](https://github.com/michaelryanmcneill/shibboleth/pull/5).
 - Reverted to using `$_SERVER` in `shibboleth_getenv()` to handle use cases where `getenv()` doesn't return data; [thanks to @jmdemuth for reporting](https://github.com/michaelryanmcneill/shibboleth/issues/7).

= version 1.8 (2017-08-23) =
The Shibboleth plugin is now being maintained by [michaelryanmcneill](https://profiles.wordpress.org/michaelryanmcneill). Contributions are welcome on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelryanmcneill/shibboleth)!

 - Adding the ability to disable `.htaccess` modifications with a `wp-config.php` constant (`SHIBBOLETH_DISALLOW_FILE_MODS`).
